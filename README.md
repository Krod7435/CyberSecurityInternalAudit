# CyberSecurityInternalAudit
In this tab lab project, i made a YouTube video demonstrating how to create a Cybersecurity based internal audit. This projected consisted of using a fake generic business that needed a security internal audit done. The lab demonstrates the steps taken to conduct one. The test involves using a risk assessment documentation report to test the potential vulnerabilities /exploits a business may potentially have. The layout document for the risk assessment starts with a scope, company goals, and current assets a business carries to show its components of what it uses in its infrastructure. The test then gets evaluated and reviewed by using a controls/compliance checklist to determine the exploits/vulnerabilties the business may have to analyze and verify if it's up to date with business regulations from legal government oversight standards. At the very end of the test audit, i wrote down suggested recommendations the business should consider using to increase the security measures from potential risk consequences. I point out all the weaknesses the business can lead their problems into and explain what best solutions should be used to protect their means of security infrastructure overall. After that is done, the audit has now be completed. This demonstration shows the full process of what a security audit is done in this manner.
